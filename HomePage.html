    <div>
        <p>After seeing someone with a very expensive Italian sports car I decided to report on my great motoring
            history</p>
    </div>

    <h3 id="1984 Fiat Uno SX">1984 Fiat Uno SX</h3>
    <img src="uno.jpg" alt="Uno"><br>
    <p>It had rust holes in the dorrs and was not really safe to drive. And in around 1999 it caught fire outside a
        chinese take away. I asked for a bucket of water and they said it would cost 10 pounds. I did not have 10
        pounds. So the car when to the great parking p,ace in the sky. Cost 250</p>


    <h3 id="1976 Spitfire">1976 Spitfire</h3>
    <img src="triumph-spitfire-mk4-1976-t8923-037.webp" alt="Spitfire"><br>
    <p>It was an old British Leyland car, so were the tanks I had to work with at the time. So the parts were all the
        same, therefore, half the car was stolen. Cost 2000</p>

    <h3 id="Mazda Van">Mazda Van id=Mazda Van</h3>
    <img src="mazda-bongo-brawny-06.jpg" alt="mazda"><br>
    <p>Plans changed. I had to sell it becaus I got a normal job and it would never start before 11am. Cost 1500</p>

    <h3 id="Holden"> 1979 WB Holden Panel Van</h4>
        <img src="WB-Panel-Van-front-side.jpg" alt="Holden"><br>
        <p>By far the best car/van I've ever owned, however, at the time I had a pregnant partner that wantaed an air
            conditioned car. Cost 1800</p>

        <h3 id="Corolla">1998 Toyota Corolla</h3>
        <img src="1998 corolla.jpg" alt="corolla"><br>
        <p>It had air conditioning. Cost 1600</p>

        <h3 id="Starlet">1997 Toyota Starlet</h3>
        <img src="starlet.jpg" alt="starlet"><br>
        <p>Got it when I moved back to Berlin. What more can I say. Cost 200</p>
